## Decision Outputs
## Decision Inputs
- Average hourly footfall
- Peak hour footfall
- Percentage of time at high occupancy
- Sustained high-usage duration

## Threshold Philosophy
- Decisions are based on sustained patterns, not single spikes
- Peak usage alone should not trigger permanent action
- Temporary overcrowding leads to monitoring, not expansion
- Capacity-related actions must be conservative due to proxy data

## Data-to-Decision Mapping
- Average hourly footfall → total count column (aggregated by hour)
- Peak hour footfall → maximum hourly count per day
- Percentage of time at high occupancy → proportion of hours above a chosen threshold
- Sustained high-usage duration → consecutive hours above threshold

Primary footfall signal: Total_Occupancy

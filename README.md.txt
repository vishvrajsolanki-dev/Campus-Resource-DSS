## Conclusion

Using real hourly library occupancy data, this Decision Support System
identified sustained evening-time usage pressure.

Rather than recommending structural expansion, the system concludes that
extending operating hours is the most cost-effective and proportionate
response.

This decision is based on sustained high-occupancy patterns concentrated
in evening periods, while overall daily usage does not justify permanent
seating expansion.

The system prioritizes conservative, explainable decisions over predictive
accuracy, making it suitable for real-world campus operations.
